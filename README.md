Social Explore
=============

Instead of finding out what the news outlet tells you, I often asked myself, what does other people around the world have to say about this?

Social Explore aims to aggregrate this results from public posts, status from large social networks. 

Social Explore uses JQuery Mobile as the frontend, CakePHP as its code framework and SQL as the underlying database, with many integrations to Facebook, Twitter, Instragram, Renren and Weibo.
